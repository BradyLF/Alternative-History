                      The politician, Tip O’Neill, claimed in his memoirs that both men had in fact heard shots from the grassy knoll:<br><br>  
                      I was never one of those people who had doubts or suspicions about the Warren Commission’s report on the president’s death. But five years after Jack died, I was having dinner with Kenny O’Donnell and a few other people at Jimmy’s Harborside Restaurant in Boston, and we got to talking about the assassination.<br><br>
                     
					  I was surprised to hear O’Donnell say that he was sure he had heard two shots that came from behind the fence.<br><br>
					  “That’s not what you told the Warren Commission,” I said.<br><br>
					  “You’re right, ” he replied. “I told the FBI what I had heard, but they said it couldn’t have happened that way and that I must have been imagining things. So I testified the way they wanted me to. I just didn’t want to stir up any more pain and trouble for the family.”<br><br>
					  “I can’t believe it,” I said. ”I wouldn’t have done that in a million years. I would have told them the truth.”<br><br><br>

Ruby initially refuses, but is very quickly desperate for treatment as well as Delirious and weak from his cancer. Ruby fatally shoots Lee Harvey Oswald, who was in police custody after being charged with the murder of John F. Kennedy two days earlier. A Dallas jury found Ruby guilty of murdering Oswald, and Ruby was sentenced to death. Later, Ruby appealed his conviction and was granted a new trial. As the date for his new trial was being set, Ruby died of a pulmonary embolism due to lung cancer.

"He found out the CIA was trying to kill (Cuban leader Fidel) Castro, which is a fact. So the argument is that the CIA felt that Kennedy was going to disband them. And as a result of that, they were the ones that ordered the killing of Kennedy.<br><br>

Many gathered in public places to watch the television coverage. Traffic in some areas came to a halt as the news spread from car to car. Schools across the U.S. dismissed their students early. Misplaced anger against Texas and Texans was reported from some individuals. Various Cleveland Browns fans, for example, carried signs at the next Sunday's home game against the Dallas Cowboys decrying the city of Dallas as having "killed the president." The event left a lasting impression on many Americans. As with the December 7, 1941 attack on Pearl Harbor before it and the September 11, 2001 attacks after it, asking "Where were you when you heard about Kennedy's assassination?" would become a common topic of discussion.</h5></a>
