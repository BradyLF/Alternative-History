                     <h5> In October 1945, during the final stage of the Second World War, the United States invaded mainland Japan on an unprecedented scale. The attack was the most audacious battle of the Pacific theatre. Resulting in significant casualties for both the Japanese, and the Americans.</h5>

               <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Operation_Downfall">
                  <h5>Beginning in October 1945, Operation Olympic was intended to capture the southern third of the southernmost main Japanese island, Kyūshū, with the recently captured island of Okinawa to be used as a staging area. Later, in spring 1946, Operation Coronet was the planned invasion of the Kantō Plain, near Tokyo, on the Japanese island of Honshū. Airbases on Kyūshū captured in Operation Olympic would allow land-based air support for Operation Coronet. If Downfall had taken place, it would have been the largest amphibious operation in human history.<br><br><br><br></h5>

                     Japan’s geography made an invasion very predictable to Japan. Because of the high tensions between the US and Japan an invasion was imminent and using the strategy of island hopping, as the US did before, was very predictable. The Japanese adjusted their defense strategy to accommodate Operation Olympic and guarded the island of Kyūshū
